# REST.API - rules:

1. We should use simple and common naming convention. kebab-case is perfect here. Smallcase and "-".
2. Application and backend should be developed separately. For this reason we have to use simple naming enpoints (route names).

Standard REST:
GET /movies
POST /movies
UPDATE /movies
DELETE /movies

instead of naming like: 
"GET /getMovies"

It is highly advisable to use nouns rather than verbs.
For the same reason, we should use plural nouns names than singular ones.
